Weather forecasting has been still dependent on statistical and numerical analysis in most part of the world. Though statistical and numerical analysis provides better results, it highly depends on stable historical relationships with the predict and predicting value of the predict and at a future time. On the other hand, Machine learning explores new algorithmic approaches in prediction which is based on data-driven prediction. Climatic changes for a location are dependent on variable factors like temperature, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed and combination of other such factors which are variable in nature. Since climatic changes are location-based statistical and numerical approaches result in failure at times and needs an alternate method like machine learning based study of understanding about the weather forecast. In this study we have prepared a tiny ML model for temperature prediction by using TensorFlow library running on Arduino nano 33 BLE running an onboard temperature forecasting algorithm. The dataset used are from Max plank Institute of Biogeochemistry. The model was finally optimized to run with Arduino nano 33 BLE with the forecasting algorithm.
